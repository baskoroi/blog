## About me

I am Baskoro Indrayana, currently working as an [advanced tools/architecture consultant](https://linkedin.com/in/baskoroi) at [ABeam LightStream Analytics](https://lightstream.asia). At work, I mostly deal with data integration/architecture and also software development. I have had experience working on newer technologies, i.e. cloud-enabled Internet of Things, and currently machine/deep learning for self-study.

I have long held the passion for technology since age 5, when I received my first Macintosh computer from my father. It was the impetus to all my other tech-related skills: Photoshopping, web/mobile development, 

When I'm not doing this techy stuff, I:
- listen to metal and occasionally jazz, 
- play drums, 
- learn about musicians' gears beyond just drums, 
- learn the band formation,
- read random set of books, 
- watch professional chefs' recipes, 
- make silly comments and spam out my favorite songs as Instagram stories, and 
- watch some YouTube inspiration or [uncommon people](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=david+goggins&page=&utm_source=opensearch).

## Plan for this blog

This blog is an outlet for my daily self-study, on the following topics:
- math, 
- machine learning / deep learning, 
- hopefully some degree of software development,
- ...and possibly other things.

In each post, I may attempt to flesh out a particular topic (or a book chapter), and interweave/correlate them with other related concepts to reinforce the collective knowledge. Or I practice on a Kaggle dataset, competition, or a fundamental paper.

I am currently undertaking a course from [Udacity](https://udacity.com) titled ["Secure and Private AI"](https://www.udacity.com/course/secure-and-private-ai--ud185). For those feeling Udacious, this blog is also part of my work within said course.

In this information-rich era, I strongly believe that self-study is an [important](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) [skill](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/learning-how-to-learn-a-must-have-skill-as-a-lifelong-student-29d7fad6d99e) to cultivate. With knowledge being everywhere, it is easier for us to learn from a variety of many subjects. Consequentially, the competition pool increases (regardless of their average knowledge level), and demand for better expertise under that comparison is certainly a deciding factor to our success.
